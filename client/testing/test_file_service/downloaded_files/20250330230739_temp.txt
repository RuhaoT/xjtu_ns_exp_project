But instead of an official reponse, the pen trembles in Kiran's hand. "That was..." Her head shakes when she breathes out, not a sigh, but more like a relief. "That was much better than I thought. I thought you would choose to return to your hoard. If our paths are deterministic, if I was my old self, you probably have been anatomized. But before that, I would already have died beneath your claws that day in the cave." She nods at the dragon, no longer wearing the glacial scale of the Bureau, but almost sincerely.
"I don't *take control* of your procedure; it's the administrative. But as I said, the procedure is adjustable based on *observations*. So I designed this, making the offer into a **test**. And you actually chose the ***third path***- to **pick up your pen**, a testimony of conscious individuality on a creature lived under transcendents...I mean, *distant echoes*, for centuries; the thing **precious** not only for you or Bureau's research, but for **me**, one trying to uncover the echo behind me, to prevent such thing from happening again, to *pay my price*." For the first time, on her face pale lights shird upon, there is a trace of delight. "So ***yes***, with your previous response as evidence, I could make the Bureau provide you a *third path*. If you could help in *rewriting not only yourself.*"
"But know this, Smaug," She spoke his name not query-like, yet her voice drops, "This is a dangerous move that, if known, puts me and the FBC against the justice of this world, potentially hindering our expedition. **Even if you chose the third path, what will you expect? How will you face the world you once hurt upon?**" "Tell me if I misunderstood your choice. The Dimensional Research still awaits subjects to test out Morgoth's resonance."
